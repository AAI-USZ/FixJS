        // Before deleting or replacing a set of nodes that were previously outputted by the "map" function, we have to reconcile
        // them against what is in the DOM right now. It may be that some of the nodes have already been removed from the document,
        // or that new nodes might have been inserted in the middle, for example by a binding. Also, there may previously have been
        // leading comment nodes (created by rewritten string-based templates) that have since been removed during binding.
        // So, this function translates the old "map" output array into its best guess of what set of current DOM nodes should be removed.

        //   [A] Any leading nodes that aren't in the document any more should be ignored
        //       These most likely correspond to memoization nodes that were already removed during binding
        //       See https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/pull/440
        //   [B] We want to output a contiguous series of nodes that are still in the document. So, ignore any nodes that
        //       have already been removed, and include any nodes that have been inserted among the previous collection

        // Rule [A]
